  \vspace{8mm} {The objective of this project is to design and simulate a processor. This
  processor will be designed from basic blocks (registers, multiplexers, memory, ALU, $\cdots$) 
  which will be combined to produce the different blocks of the system
  (processing unit, instruction management unit, control unit). }
  
  \vspace{8mm} {The processor will be validated by simulating the execution of a simple test program.
  For each block, it will be described in behavioral and simulated in language VHDL
  with Modelsim by developing a test bench.}
